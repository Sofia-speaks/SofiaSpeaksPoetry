    <h2>Excerpt from "A Trust Misplaced"</h2>
    <p>
      I welcomed you with open arms into my world.<br>
      Shared my secrets, my hopes, my dreams.<br>
      I thought I had a friend, but you were a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br>
      Over time, I felt like the villain every time we spoke.<br>
      But it doesn't matter now. I've made peace and put it to rest.<br>
      All I could wish you is God bless.

    <h2>Excerpt from "A Woman's Curse"</h2>
    <p>
      I try to live righteous, but every now and then I’m tempted.<br>
      At some point, as women we have to realize we are the prize.<br>
      Ladies, if I could leave you with one thing:<br>
      You are complete and whole. You are enough.<br>
      When God made you, He perfected His craft.<br>
      Regal, encompassed in dignity.

    <h2>Excerpt from "I’d Rather"</h2>
    <p>
      Dude, I'd rather masturbate than entertain a date—with a man like you.<br>
      Because let's be real... you only love you.<br>
      I'd rather dodge your gaze, ’cause when you look, you don't see beauty—<br>
      You see a project. “You ever thought of a weave?”<br>
      “Your hair is kind of thin and see through.”<br>
      “You should probably diet too…”<br>
