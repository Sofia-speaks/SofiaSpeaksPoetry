    <h2>Excerpt from "A Trust Misplaced"</h2>
    <p>
      You were different. I welcomed you with open arms into my world, sharing my secrets, my hopes, and my dreams. I thought I had a friend but it was a wolf in sheep’s clothing it would seem. The crazy thing is you felt like my sister. Pride aside I still do miss her. The laugh we shared the conversations that helped me reflect.

    <h2>Excerpt from "A Woman's Curse"</h2>
    <p>
      I try to live righteous I am still no nun but I like to think I do my best to represent what God would have of me but every now and then I'm tempted by no other than that sly guy that was in the garden with Eve I think it's Adam that has always deceived I see him in different skins always pretending so I'd let him in telling me sweet lies like how I'm so thin.

    <h2>Excerpt from "I’d Rather"</h2>
    <p>
      Dude, I'd rather masturbate than entertain a date—with a man like you. Because let's be real... you only love you. I'd rather dodge your gaze, 'cause when you look, you don't see beauty—you see a project. "You ever thought of a weave?" "Your hair is kind of thin and see through."
